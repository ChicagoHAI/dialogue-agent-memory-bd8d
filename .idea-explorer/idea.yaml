  title: Teaching Dialogue Agents to Detect Their Own Memory Gaps Through Policy Simulation
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Dialogue agents equipped with a meta-cognitive framework that simulates
    responses under multiple memory policies and measures response divergence can
    detect their own memory gaps, enabling them to take corrective actions such as
    searching conversation history, asking users for clarification, or expressing
    uncertainty.

    '
  background:
    description: Inspired by AbsenceBench, dialogue agents using memory systems inevitably
      forget conversation details due to storage constraints. Agents do not know when
      they have forgotten something important, which can lead to harmful outputs such
      as recommending peanut dishes to users with nut allergies or contradicting commitments
      made many turns earlier. This idea proposes a meta-cognitive framework that
      enables agents to detect memory gaps by simulating "what if I remembered differently?"
      The approach involves generating responses under multiple memory policies (e.g.,
      store everything, recent only, semantic search, importance weighted), measuring
      response divergence across these policies, and taking corrective actions when
      high divergence is detected.
