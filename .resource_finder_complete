QUALITY METRICS
---------------
Time Spent: ~2.5 hours
Papers Quality: All recent (2022-2025), highly relevant, from top venues
Dataset Quality: Standard benchmarks + novel datasets from top papers
Code Quality: Official implementations + well-maintained community projects
Documentation: Comprehensive, actionable, ready for experiment runner

KEY FINDINGS FROM LITERATURE
-----------------------------
1. Memory systems can be structured with multiple types (episodic, semantic, etc.)
2. LLMs have intrinsic self-knowledge capabilities that improve with scale
3. Uncertainty can be estimated via multiple methods (verbalized, token-prob, sampling)
4. Long-term memory is challenging - current LLMs fail beyond ~100 turns
5. Gap in literature: No existing work on memory gap detection via policy simulation

RECOMMENDED APPROACH
--------------------
Primary Dataset: LoCoMo (long-term memory evaluation)
Secondary Dataset: MultiWOZ (dialogue state tracking validation)
Baseline Code: memory-agent (LangChain) for infrastructure
Methods: LLM-Uncertainty-Bench for divergence measurement
Key Innovation: Simulate multiple memory policies, measure response divergence

NEXT STEPS FOR EXPERIMENT RUNNER
---------------------------------
1. Review literature_review.md for research context
2. Study datasets/README.md for data formats
3. Review code/README.md for implementation guidance
4. Design experiments based on literature recommendations
5. Implement policy simulation system
6. Evaluate on LoCoMo and MultiWOZ
7. Report results and compare against baselines
