## RESOURCE FINDING PHASE COMPLETE ✓

I have successfully completed the resource gathering phase for your research project on **"Teaching Dialogue Agents to Detect Their Own Memory Gaps Through Policy Simulation"**.

### What Has Been Accomplished

**📚 Papers (10 total, 14 MB)**
- Downloaded 10 highly relevant research papers from 2022-2025
- Coverage: Memory systems (4), Self-knowledge (3), Uncertainty estimation (2), Surveys (1)
- All papers from top venues (ACL, EMNLP) or high-quality arXiv preprints
- Documented in `papers/README.md`

**📊 Datasets (4 total, 267 MB)**
- **LoCoMo**: Long-term conversational memory (10 conversations, 300+ turns each)
- **SelfAware**: Unanswerable questions for self-knowledge testing (3,369 questions)
- **MultiWOZ**: Task-oriented dialogue with state tracking (10,438 dialogues)
- **Prosocial Dialog**: Multi-turn conversations (165,681 examples)
- All validated and ready to use
- Git-friendly setup with .gitignore and download instructions in `datasets/README.md`

**💻 Code Repositories (4 total)**
- **memory-agent** (LangChain): Production-ready conversational memory
- **IC-DST**: SOTA dialogue state tracking baseline (EMNLP 2022)
- **LLM-Uncertainty-Bench**: Comprehensive uncertainty quantification toolkit
- **awesome-llm-uncertainty**: Curated resources on LLM uncertainty
- All documented in `code/README.md`

**📝 Documentation (5 comprehensive guides)**
- `literature_review.md`: 15-page synthesis of all papers with methodology, metrics, and recommendations
- `resources.md`: Complete catalog of all resources with usage guidance
- `papers/README.md`: Detailed paper descriptions
- `datasets/README.md`: Dataset descriptions with download/loading instructions
- `code/README.md`: Repository descriptions with integration recommendations

### Key Research Insights

From the literature review, I identified:

1. **Gap in Current Research**: No existing work directly addresses memory gap detection through policy simulation
2. **Foundational Capabilities**: LLMs have intrinsic self-knowledge that improves with scale
3. **Memory Challenge**: Current systems fail on conversations beyond ~100 turns
4. **Recommended Approach**: 
   - Simulate 3+ memory policies (full, partial, none)
   - Measure response divergence using semantic similarity
   - Use LoCoMo as primary testbed
   - Validate on MultiWOZ for task-oriented dialogue

### Ready for Experimentation

The workspace is fully prepared with:
- ✅ All resources downloaded and validated
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for each component
- ✅ Clear experimental recommendations
- ✅ Baseline implementations ready to extend
- ✅ Completion marker file created

### Next Steps

The experiment runner phase can now:
1. Review `literature_review.md` for research context and methodology
2. Study dataset formats via `datasets/README.md`
3. Set up baseline implementations from `code/README.md`
4. Implement policy simulation system
5. Run evaluations on LoCoMo and MultiWOZ
6. Compare results against baselines

**Total Time**: ~2.5 hours  
**Quality**: High - recent papers, standard benchmarks, official implementations  
**Status**: ✅ Complete and ready for next phase

All resources are organized, documented, and validated. The foundation is solid for implementing your novel approach to teaching dialogue agents to detect their own memory gaps!
